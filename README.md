# VACSHIELD
3RD SEMESTER PROJECT
During this covid-19 pandemic, we Indians faced a lot of difficulties due to our large population. The only way to prevent this pandemic was to vaccinate each and every citizen of our nation. Now vaccinating everyone is not a piece of cake. It requires a lot of planning therefore the government of India came up with a master plan. They decided to register those, who are willing to vaccinate themselves, via online mode to prevent mass gathering of people. The plan was a success and now majority of Indian citizens are vaccinated.
Recently our team got this golden opportunity to make a project using data structures and our team decided to make full use of this opportunity. We decided to make an online portal to people for vaccination.   
The idea of this project revolves around the concept of checking if a person is vaccinated or not and to choose his / her vaccination slot according to his vaccination status (vaccinated or not). And finally printing his or her vaccination certificate mentioning his/her details, status of vaccination along with the verification key (a unique sequence of alpha-numeric characters used for verification of certificates).
